# shrug-bot
A discord bot to photoshop your avatar onto a shrug.

# Why???
I was talking in my [lovely Python discord server](https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT) when I thought "Hey, you know what this needs more of? Shrugging." so I made this.

# Usage
1. Have python 3.5+
2. Clone source code from GitHub
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
4. Create an environment variable called `TOKEN` with your bots token
5. Run `__main__.py`

Easy peasy lemon squeasy.
